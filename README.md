Kryptnostic-Instrumentation
=======================


Client for user statistics logging services. A more detailed description of the logging services can be found here: http://wiki.krypt.int/display/PS/Kryptnostic+Instrumentation+and+Metrics

instrumentation.yaml contains the URL of the server that hosts the metrics service; during deployment, if metrics is hosted on a different server than heracles or services, the metrics URL must be updated to accurately reflect the location of kryptnostic-metrics.
